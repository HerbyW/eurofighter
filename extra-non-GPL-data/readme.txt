- copy both ETSN files into your fgdata Models/Airport folder
- start your aircraft at ETSN so that you have the scenery
- override the file ...stg in the Objects folder of your scenery
- restart Flightgear in ETSI (!), it is 20 km east from ETSN
- heading of 267 and you will see the new airport as it is in GOOGLE
- starting in ETSN gives you some problems with the new airport, as it is a few meter above it
