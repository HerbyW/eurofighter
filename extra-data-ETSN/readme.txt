Special Scenery for Neuburg (ETSN) and Laage (ETSL).

!! GPL !! Open Street Data (primitiv)

- copy both ETSN (ac and png) files into your fgdata Models/Airport folder
- start your aircraft at ETSN so that you have the scenery
- override the file ETSN-e011n48-3138216.stg in the Objects folder of your scenery
- restart Flightgear in ETSI (!), it is 20 km east from ETSN
- heading of 267 and you will see the new airport as it is in Open street map.
- starting in ETSN gives you some problems with the new airport, as it is a few meter above it

OR: (super beautiful)

You install 1.6 GB Data from here:

https://github.com/D-ECHO/CentralEuropeCustomScenery

and copy the content from both Terrain-.... files into the same files in the folders.


In both cases:

the files for the lowpoly aircrafts into /Models/Aircraft

Have fun!
