- use the keyboard to select the new value
- hit ENT (enter) to validate the entry
- hit CLR (clear) to erase it and retype if needed

ULP

 AP : cancel all AP functions
 AT : auto thrust - maintain the speed in kt
      Alt key + AT :speed in mach
 HDG : hold Heading 
 TRK : track hold (when used with AIDS/TACAN mode, VOR mode, Nav mode)
       or True heading hold (when used with AIDS / Alt + Nav mode
 Alt key + TRK : Roll hold
 ALT :altitude hold
 Alt key + ALT : Pitch hold
 TFR : terrain following, holds AGL altitude (caution in mountains…)
